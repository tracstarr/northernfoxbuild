While I'm waiting on some answers about the Oratex requirements by the MDRA I've moved on to more pre-work for covering. 
The wings and other surfaces needed much more prep work to really smooth out the transitions and attachment areas. A lot
more superfil and sanding was done. Additionally, all areas that would require glue were preped with primer and then 
lightly sanded as per the documentation for Oratex glue. I really think the effort is going to pay off.
