Well, it's a big day here. My first inspection by the local MDRA. This is the pre-cover inspection. It was rather 
uneventful, which is good. Everything went smooth and I have the thumbs up to move ahead with covering. Super excited!
The only think I need to do is provide pictures of the final pitot tube plumbing before it's covered since there will 
be no access without cutting an access hole.

Time for Oratex!
