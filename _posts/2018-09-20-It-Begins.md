Today was more progress. Took apart the pedal assembly and found it needs to be greased. Put them back in, got all the connections done and control sticks in. They'll be coming out again for re-paint eventually. 

One of the modifications done today was to use nutplates for the pedal attachments to the frame. This will allow easy removal for future inspection etc.
