J-Stringers cut, fit and secured today. These were originally already completed 
when I bought the kit, but they were removed for sandblasting and were
damaged enough to just get some new material. Was pretty cheap to do all 
considered.

Not overly complicated so things went pretty smooth. Filed them at the 
tail to have a smoother profile vs the chipmunk cheek look you get
without. 

Also decided to make the bottom stringer out of aluminum as well.
