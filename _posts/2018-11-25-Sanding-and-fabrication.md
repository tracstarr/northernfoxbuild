The last few days was spent sanding and fabricating. The false bottom ribs were
cut out to fit on the bottoms of the tanks and then hysoled on. Then there
was a lot of sanding. Using a level all of the false ribs were sanded slightly to 
make the profiles perfect to make the fabric sit as nicely as possible.

There was also a small bit of fabrication to make and install the pitot tube
mounting plate. 

Additionally the rudder cable install was completed. A hair dryer and 
paint cans were used to help straighten out the tube which the cable runs.
With a bit of difficulty, the cables were setup and attached in the rear.

##### ORATEX ARRIVED

The big excitement this week was that the oratex arrived! I'm glad it arrived early
and I'm not stuck waiting on it. But now I feel the pressure to get things
completed for pre-cover inspection. 

I'm close, really really close. 

Here's what's left.

- fitting and installing the jury struts. 
- install the pitot tube and tubing runs.
- varnish all the wood
- sand and re-prime the tail
- prep and paint the door frame and window frames black
- paint the visible parts inside the cabbin black
- fabricate and install trim tab mounting bracket on rudder
- secure the LLE
