Well, two bits of news that's exciting for me. 

1- got my shipment from Kitfox with my FFW, LLE and some other bits I needed.

2 - finally (as in yesterday) found someone who is willing and able to take on the blasting and powder coating of my frame. He's done some air frames in the past. Excited to get going on this now. 

I guess my next post will be dis-assembly of the entire fuselage which was complete. Oh well.
