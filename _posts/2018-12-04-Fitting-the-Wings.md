The past week a lot of little things got done. There was a lot final tightening of most things within the fuselage and 
adding witness marks. 

A bit of tweaking of the pitot mounting bracket and arm was needed to get a good fit. I decided to mount the arm such
that it's accessed from the inside only. The reason is I think there will be a much nicer finish with the oratex this 
way. The drawback is that the pitot does have to be fully installed before covering the wing and if anything goes wrong
I will have to cut my way in to fix it.

The big step was putting the wings onto the fuselage and making sure all of the dimensions and angles were correct. This
went pretty smooth with some help and everything was spot on. It's a zero degree setup as I am installing the 912IS.
