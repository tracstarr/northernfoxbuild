I've secured my engine. I will be going with a 912is Sport factory new. Got a great deal on it (i think anyway) as it's an older model year. They jacked up the prices recently and no longer include exhaust/ring mounts. 

I've also ordered from Kitfox all the additional bits I need/want as well as the FWF kit. Probably 6 weeks out on delivery there. 

Ordered some Oratex samples - so need to make some decisions on color scheme. 

Still working out my avionics situation but pretty sure going all Garmin.
